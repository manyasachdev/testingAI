Abstract:

This paper examines the power of mathematical and computational processes in a subjective, product design problem scenario. In this, the paper deals with text-toimage models to generate innovative designs and then aims to optimize the designs generated with the help of genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs are popular in navigating complex problem areas, especially those where value can be expressed in computable equations and results can be visualized by automated simulations. The algorithm leverages classic evolutionary processes to search large population spaces. A reference paper has been cited that details an interesting way of representing products as binary strings and performing computations on them. Human subjectivity in design has been accounted for when designing the fitness function to measure how good each solution is. The share of choices principle has been applied, highlighting the need and importance of user feedback in design. The product chosen for this experiment is a musical instrument. For further evaluation, a prototype of the product was built and gesture control functionality was added to it. Results point to an optimistic scenario as fitness values followed an upward trend across generations.
